'''
import random

starting_number = random.randint(20, 30)
turn = 0

print('If you get 0 you will loose..')
print('Starting number is:', starting_number)

while starting_number > 0:
    if turn % 2 == 0:
        starting_number -= int(input('Choose number from 1 to 3: '))
        turn += 1
        print(starting_number)
        if starting_number <= 0:
            print('Player lost the game.')
    elif turn % 2 != 0:
        print('Computer is choosing.')
        starting_number -= random.randint(1, 3)
        turn += 1
        print(starting_number)
        if starting_number <= 0:
            print('Computer lost the game.')
