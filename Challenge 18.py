'''
Write a procedure(sub) drawstars that will draw a sequence of
spaces followed by a sequence of stars. It should accept two parametersâ€”the number of spaces and the number of stars.
E.g
Drawstars(3,5) would produce
_ _ _ * * * * * ( _ indicates a space!)

Extension
Now write a program using this procedure that will draw a pyramid whose base is a width specified by the user. E.g.
Enter base size of pyramid : 5
*
***
*****
(assume the user has to enter an odd number)    I did't assume. I've made sure it will be odd.
